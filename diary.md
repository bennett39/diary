**Streak** 2

**Today's Projects** Two more exercism problems. Finally getting my
command line working the way I want it to.

**Thoughts** I'll probably code more today, but wanted to go ahead and
write my daily log.

I was getting frustrated with debugging javascript from the command
line, but I found that node will run javascript files `$ node file.js`
and the exercism test suite using `npm test` also prints out any
`console.log()` calls.

I'd like to start on my big projects today. Maybe get the barebones
Django up and running on my budget app. I already have a lot of the
backend stuff for that one figured out since I built it before. Now, I
just need to port it to Django and refresh my memory on the Personal
Capital API.

**Streak** 1

**Today's projects** Writing about React, setting up command line
config, starting `exercism` repository.

**Thoughts** I was starting to get annoyed with the format of the
100DaysOfCode journal. I also recently wiped my installation of Linux
and am starting fresh with a new Crouton CLI.

New project: dive into JavaScript via exercises on exercism. My thoughts
on my path moving forward:

- Get good at JavaScript, learn trivia for interviews
- Practice on LeetCode and exercism in JavaScript & Python for
  interviews
- Rebuild my budget app with dummy data for someone to log in. Then, use
  Vue to render it, a JS library for data viz, automatic updates with
  Airflow, and some type of session managment like Redis. Use a Django
  backend for rapid development.
- Redo my portfolio using Gatsby.js
- Build a Sudoku site with tons of puzzles created in React, a solver
  that shows answers or gives hints, and sessions so users can track how
  many puzzles they've solved and their best times (maybe with OAuth
  through other logins like Google?). This would be a NodeJS backend and
  some type of simple data store for user sessions.
